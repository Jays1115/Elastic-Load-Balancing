# Elastic Load Balancing

<h2>Description</h2>
Scenario: a travel agency that recently held a promotional event. The event significantly increased web traffic, causing the agency's website to become overloaded and unable to handle the influx of requests, leading to timeouts. Additionally, the agency's EC2 instances, hosted on AWS in an Availability Zone, were affected by severe storms, which resulted in the website being offline for several hours.
<br/> <br/>
Solution: To manage traffic surges and maintain website uptime, create an Auto Scaling Group that adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. Set up a Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly across these instances, and attach the Auto Scaling Group to it for seamless scalability. Implement Load Balancer Health Checks to ensure traffic is only directed to healthy instances, enhancing the reliability of your service.

<h3 align="center">Creating the Load Balancer & Configuring Complimentary Settings</h3>

<p align="center">
Returned to the details tab of the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and scrolled down to the section on Load Balancers. Here, I added an internet-facing application load balancer, which connects to three public subnets across three different availability zones. Additionally, I created a new target group: <br/>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="center">
Navigated to "Security Groups" via the left side bar to create a new security group for the load balancer: <br/>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="center">
I configured the load balancer settings to allow inbound HTTP traffic from the internet and directed outbound traffic to the security group of the travel agency web server: <br/>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="center">
I returned to "Security Group" through the left sidebar, selecting the TravelAgencyWebServer security group to modify its inbound rules. I deleted the existing rule and replaced it with a new rule that permits HTTP traffic from the recently created load balancer: <br/>

<p align="center">
I accessed the "Load Balancers" page through the left sidebar and clicked on the load balancer I had previously created: <br/>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="center">
I scrolled down to locate the security tab for this load balancer and updated its security group to the Travel Agency LoadBalancer security group that I had created earlier: <br/>

<p align="center">
I copied the DNS name of the load balancer and pasted it into a new browser tab: <br/>

<h3 align="center">Configuring Health Checks</h3>

<p align="center">
I navigated to the target groups page, selected the "TravelAgencyWebServers" target group, and then clicked on the "health checks" tab: <br/>

</p>

<p align="center">
Edits Applied to Health Check Setting:
- Changed Health Check Protocol to HTTP: Ensures compatibility with web applications.
- Reduced Healthy Threshold to 5: Speeds up routing to stable instances.
- Lowered Unhealthy Threshold to 2: Quickly removes failing instances.
- Shortened Health Check Interval to 5 Seconds: Allows faster detection of server issues. <br/>

<h3 align="center">Adding Subnets to the Auto Scaling Group & Testing </h3>

<p align="center">
Navigated to the Auto Scaling Groups and updated the network settings, adding the Private Subnet 1 from availability zone us-east-1a: <br/>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="center">
I navigated back to the instances, then terminated the running instance. Changing the subnet alone does not trigger an automatic rebuild of instances within the Auto Scaling group. However, terminating the instance reduces the count below the group's minimum, prompting the Auto Scaling group to launch a new instance in the private subnet: <br/>

<p align="center">
I navigated to the Auto Scaling Group (ASG), selected the "TravelAgencyWebServer" ASG, and then went to the "Activity" tab. From there, I scrolled down to view the activity history. This is another place that shows the new instance being created after the other was terminated: <br/>

<br />

<p align="center">
In the same ASG, I went to the "Details" tab, scrolled down to the network section, and added Private Subnet 2 from availability zone us-east-1b to the Auto Scaling Group (ASG): <br/>

<p align="center">
I went to the "Details" tab, scrolled down to the network section, and added Private Subnet 2 from availability zone us-east-1b to the Auto Scaling Group (ASG): <br/>

</p>

<p align="center">
I edited the group details to manually adjust the desired capacity. This allows for testing the Auto Scaling groupâ€™s behavior. Increasing the desired capacity, as long as it remains below the maximum limit, will trigger the launch of additional instances to meet the new desired capacity: <br/>

<br />
</p>

<p align="center">
Added Private Subnet 3 from availability zone us-east-1c to the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) & changed the desired capacity to 3 (steps not shown, repeat of the above steps). More instances were created, 1 instance in each availability zone: <br/>
